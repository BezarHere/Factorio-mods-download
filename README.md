# Factorio-mods-download
Download facotrio mods from the main form without any account to create

## how to use
**.exe:** insert the mods url in the command line and it will (hopfuly) download to *mods* folder next to the program
**.py:** similer to downloading in the *.exe* but the *mods* folder will be inside the root dir

## legality of downloading this way
idk i'm a programmer not a lawyer
i just want to make mods more accessible for more people
